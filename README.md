# Twitter Producer

This project is part of the `Apache Kafka Series - Learn Apache Kafka for Beginners v2` course.
In this project we'll implement a simple Producer that will get messages from Twitter and publish to Kafka.
On the other side we'll have a Consumer polling this messages and persisting in a Elasticsearch database.
